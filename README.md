# Interpreting-logs-from-DJI-iPad-Ground-Station

Run the OsdOutputer.jar file from the directory where your logs(gslog.dat & worklogfile.txt) are stored. Create a folder named "ConvertedFiles" in the same directory. The output of the logs will be created in that folder: log files containing gps and barometer data, .kml file to plot of google maps

GPS --> "gps = ( lattitude, longitude)"
Flight Dynamics --> "Dyn = (pitch,roll,yaw)"
